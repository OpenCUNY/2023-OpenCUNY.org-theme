# OpenCUNY.org Homepage WordPress Theme

## Project Description

This is the simple, static landing page for OpenCUNY.org, a WordPress MU project funded by the DGSC, The Graduate Center, CUNY. 

## Files

This theme includes the two files requied by WordPress:
	- index.php (blank because front-page.php is used instead)
