# OpenCUNY.org Homepage WordPress Theme

## Project Description

A WordPRess theme for OpenCUNY.org, a digital medium funded by the DGSC, The Graduate Center, CUNY. 

## Files

This theme includes the two files requied by WordPress:
- index.php (blank because front-page.php is used instead)
- style.css (all CSS styling rules)

As well as additional files:

- main
  - 404.php (for 404 errors)
  - archive.php (handles categories and tags; used for site search and site map)
  - footer.php (for the footer)
  - front-page.php (landing page)
  - functions.php (code that pulls information from the WordPress DB for use on templates)
  - header.php (for header)
  - index.php (used to display a page or post)
  - readme.txt (this file)
  - screenshot.png (used by WordPress theme selector)
 - assets
  - images (template-required images)
  - .js (for javascripts that need to be loaded; currently used for accordion)
  - template-parts (sections of HTML inserted into other pages with get_template_part())
    - content.php (how most content is shown between header and footer)
    - content-login.php (the login form, used on the frontpage)
    - content-welcome.php (the welcome message for logged in users, used on the frontpage)
    - content-archive.php (lists the posts/pages in a category/tag with excerpts in date order, used on archive)
