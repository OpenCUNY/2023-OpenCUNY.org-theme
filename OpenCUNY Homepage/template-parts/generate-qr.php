    <h2>Why should I use OpenCUNY's QR Code Generator?</h2>
    </h2><p>Our generator uses free and open source qrcode.js to directly translate your text/URL into a QR code in the browser. We don't append anything to your QR code to track scans or internet traffic and we don't record what QR codes are generated. That not only keeps your personal data private it also keeps the personal data of your visitors private.</p> 
    <p>QR codes and shortened links are convienient, but because they obscure the real web address, they can be used to collect personal information or direct unsuspecting people to malicious sites. The most common way QR codes generators collect data is by routing traffic through a link shortner that also collects personal data about your location, device, etc. The aggregate data of everyone's QR code traffic is valuable, but QR code generators also often sell your particular internet traffic data back to you.</p>
